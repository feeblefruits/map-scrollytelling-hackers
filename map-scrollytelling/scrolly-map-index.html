		<p class=pretty_box>On September 10, the Mail & Guardian received a notice from our hosting service, Linode. The oldest online news website in Africa was accused of plagiarism. “You must remove access to the material immediately. If you do not, Linode must remove or disable access to the material expeditiously under federal law.”</p>

	<section id='introduction' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>A few days later the M&G website was shut down over an unverified complaint amounting to censorship of the media. But we will not be cowed. We will not relent in our pursuit of holding the powerful to account. As custodians of this fine institution, we will continue to pursue the highest tenet of journalism: truth.</p>

		<p class="scroll_prompt">The original article M&G was forced to take down.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>This story all began back in May when M&G started investigating a man known by many names - Njock Ajuk Eyong, also known as <mark>AJ Ajuk</mark>, and <mark>Njuck Eyong</mark> and now <mark>NJ AYUK JD, MBA</mark> - who owns Centurion Law is from Cameroon. His website states that he is a leading energy lawyer and a strong advocate for African entrepreneurs. He studied law at the William Mitchell College of Law.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">The Mail & Guardian in June reported that this man has been alleged to have been involved in money laundering, impersonation of a United States congressman and fraud. Ajuk was also handpicked, allegedly by former Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, to be part of the multimillion South Sudan oil deal South Africa signed in 2019.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">M&G saw court records from the district court for the District of Columbia in the United States that reveal that, in 2007, Eyong was found guilty of impersonating Congressman Donald Payne so he could issue visas to at least nine people who were then living in Cameroon.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Ajuk was given numerous opportunities to provide M&G with comments. Instead, he sent the newspaper a threatening letter, never disputing that he was the man found guilty of fraud in the US back in 2007.</p>

	<section id='ghana' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Ajuk has also been flagged by Ghanaian media. In 2015, The Finder wrote that Centurion director Genevive Kabukuor Ocansey was arrested and detained for allegedly aiding a Cameroonian - Eyong - to launder $2.5 million into Ghana and repatriate $1 million to Equatorial Guinea.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='ghana' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">The report stated that, after a tip-off, officials of the Bank of Ghana undertook several months of investigations and arrested Ocansey, who on the Centurion website is the company’s director in Ghana. The article noted that:  “Her accomplice, Njoy Ayuk Eyong, also known as NJ Ayuk MBA, is out of Ghana at the moment.”</p>
