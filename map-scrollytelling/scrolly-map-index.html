		<p class=pretty_box>On September 10, the <i>Mail & Guardian</i> received a notice from our hosting service, Linode.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='introduction' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>The oldest online news website in Africa was accused of plagiarism.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='introduction' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>“You must remove access to the material immediately. If you do not, Linode must remove or disable access to the material expeditiously under federal law,” the email stated referring to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act copyright law.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='introduction' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>A few days later the <i>M&G</i> website was shut down over an unverified complaint amounting to censorship of the media.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='introduction' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>But we will not be cowed. We will not relent in our pursuit of holding the powerful to account. As custodians of this fine institution, we will continue to pursue the highest tenet of journalism: truth.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='introduction' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=block-header>Censored</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>This story all began in Cameroon.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>In May <i>M&G</i> started investigating a man known by many names - Njock Ajuk Eyong, also known as <mark>AJ Ajuk</mark>, and <mark>Njuck Eyong</mark> and now <mark>NJ AYUK JD, MBA</mark> - who owns Centurion Law is from Cameroon.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon-zoom' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>His website states that he is a leading energy lawyer and a strong advocate for African entrepreneurs. He studied law at the William Mitchell College of Law.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box"><i>M&G</i> in June reported that this man has been alleged to have been involved in money laundering, impersonation of a United States congressman and fraud.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Ajuk was also handpicked, allegedly by former Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, to be part of the multimillion South Sudan oil deal South Africa signed in 2019. <mark>The deal's estimated worth is R14.5-billion</mark></p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box"><i>M&G</i> saw court records from the district court for the District of Columbia in the United States that reveal that, in 2007, Eyong was found guilty of impersonating congressman Donald Payne so he could issue visas to at least nine people who were then living in Cameroon.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Ajuk was given numerous opportunities to provide <i>M&G</i> with comments. Instead, he sent the newspaper a threatening letter, never disputing that he was the man found guilty of fraud in the US back in 2007.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<img class="scrolly_image" src='/scrolly-map-assets/media/nj_articles_gif.gif'>
		<p class="scroll_prompt">
			Numerous publications have reported on Ajuk's fraud case.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id='ghana' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Ajuk has also been flagged by Ghanaian media.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='ghana' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">In 2015, The Finder wrote that Centurion director Genevive Kabukuor Ocansey was arrested and detained for allegedly aiding a Cameroonian — Eyong — to launder $2.5 million into Ghana and repatriate $1 million to Equatorial Guinea.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='ghana' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">The report stated that, after a tip-off, officials of the Bank of Ghana undertook several months of investigations and arrested Ocansey, who on the Centurion website is the company’s director in Ghana.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='ghana' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">The article noted that: “Her accomplice, Njoy Ayuk Eyong, also known as NJ Ayuk MBA, is out of Ghana at the moment.”</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Three months after <i>M&G</i> published the report on Eyong, we were forced to take down the article.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">
		 United States website hosting service, Linode, informed <i>M&G</i> — which headquartered in Johannesburg — that a blogger claimed that the mg.co.za domain had plagiarised one of the blog’s articles about Njock Ajuk Eyong.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='philly' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Linode, which is based in Philadelphia, gave the publication 96 hours to take down the article.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='philly' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">After reaffirming that the story had not been plagiarised, <i>M&G</i> was intent on fighting this. Complying would amount to censorship.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='philly' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Our hosting service failed to adhere with the 96 hours notice that <i>M&G</i> was granted and mg.co.za was taken offline. The article was subsequently taken down and services restored.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='philly' class='map-chapter'>
		<img class="scrolly_image_big" src="/scrolly-map-assets/media/site_takedown_stats.JPG">
		<p class="scroll_prompt">In the early hours of Friday, when our website traffic is most active, Linode suspended its services.</p>

		<img class="scrolly_image" src='/scrolly-map-assets/media/aj_censored_article.jpg'>
		<p class="scroll_prompt">This was the <i>M&G</i> story on Ajuk which has not been removed from our website. View <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190621181041/https://mg.co.za/article/2019-06-21-00-fraudster-named-in-sas-oil-deal">here</a>.</p>

		<p class=block-header>Invisible Man</p>
	</section>
	<section id='philly' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>The complainant used the name Ian Simpson who — as far as we could tell — is fake.</p>
	</section>
	</section>
	<section id='newark' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>Simpson told Linode that his address was <mark>“2428 Hilltop Haven Drive, Newark, New Jersey, 07102”</mark> but no such place can be found. A <i>M&G</i> correspondent in New York verified that the address does not exist.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='newark' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>Simpson said he was the author of World Wide News Blogspot. But since the complaint was made, the bylines of all the articles have been changed to Chris Lynn.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='newark-zoom' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>Public records of business owners in the US show that there is no one by that name living in the state of New York.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='newark-zoom' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>Simpson also provided a phone number that is out of service.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='newark-zoom' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>The posts on Simpson's blog cover topics such as online media and ethics in journalism.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='newark-zoom' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>A simple Google Search and online plagiarism checkers reveal that all of the posts on the Worldwide News Blogspot have been published on other blogs under anonymous bylines and hosted by Google’s blogging service Blogger.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='newark-zoom' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>The sites include USA In News, Kinds Info, Global News, Worldwide News, World Wide News Q and Top Unlimited Quotation.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='newark-zoom' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>The websites post plagiarised content and links that redirect to a blog called News Entrepreneurs which is authored by James Breiner.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='newark-zoom' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=block-header>The Spanish Professor</p>
	</section>
	<section id='spain' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>Currently living in Spain, Breiner teaches digital media and communication. When he is not lecturing at the University of Navarra he’s blogging about the field and his lectures around the world.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='spain' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>Little did Breiner know that his blog is at the centre of a web ring — a devious tactic used by hackers to increase traffic to their websites.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='spain-zoom' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>The <i>M&G</i> contacted Breiner in Pamplona. He maintained that he had no knowledge of the blogs as well as the names Ian Simpson and Chris Lynn.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='spain-zoom' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>“If this guy [Ian Simpson] wants to impersonate me, I'm not sure I could do anything about it. Do I think it's good? No. I'm upset about it,” he said in a staunch American accent sounding agitated.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='spain-zoom' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>“When I saw that the website in question had run three of my blog posts and linked to the original posts and my blog, I shrugged. I viewed as simply free redistribution [sic]. However, the fact that this website is accusing you of plagiarism and trying to get you shut down is worrisome.”</p>
	</section>
	<section id='spain' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>An independent source who assisted with the investigation said that even though these types of attacks are relatively uncommon, sites such as Black Hat World advertise web rings and DMCA takedowns on some parts of their forums.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='spain' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>When asked how many websites Linode has taken down in 2019, Peter Fu, who is the company’s legal council, said that approximately 1 000 host machines have been subject to “filtering” due to DMCA claims this year alone.</p>
