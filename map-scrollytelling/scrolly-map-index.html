				How the M&G got censored

		<p class=pretty_box>On September 10, the <i>Mail & Guardian</i> received a notice from our hosting service, Linode. The oldest online news website in Africa was accused of plagiarism. “You must remove access to the material immediately. If you do not, Linode must remove or disable access to the material expeditiously under federal law.”</p>
	</section>
	<section id='introduction' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>A few days later the <i>M&G</i> website was shut down over an unverified complaint amounting to censorship of the media. But we will not be cowed. We will not relent in our pursuit of holding the powerful to account. As custodians of this fine institution, we will continue to pursue the highest tenet of journalism: truth.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='introduction' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=block-header>Censored</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>This story all began back in May when <i>M&G</i> started investigating a man known by many names - Njock Ajuk Eyong, also known as <mark>AJ Ajuk</mark>, and <mark>Njuck Eyong</mark> and now <mark>NJ AYUK JD, MBA</mark> - who owns Centurion Law is from Cameroon. His website states that he is a leading energy lawyer and a strong advocate for African entrepreneurs. He studied law at the William Mitchell College of Law.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box"><i>M&G</i> in June reported that this man has been alleged to have been involved in money laundering, impersonation of a United States congressman and fraud. Ajuk was also handpicked, allegedly by former Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, to be part of the multimillion South Sudan oil deal South Africa signed in 2019. <mark>The deal's estimated worth is R14.5-billion</mark></p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box"><i>M&G</i> saw court records from the district court for the District of Columbia in the United States that reveal that, in 2007, Eyong was found guilty of impersonating congressman Donald Payne so he could issue visas to at least nine people who were then living in Cameroon.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Ajuk was given numerous opportunities to provide <i>M&G</i> with comments. Instead, he sent the newspaper a threatening letter, never disputing that he was the man found guilty of fraud in the US back in 2007.</p>

	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>

			Numerous publications have reported on Ajuk's fraud case.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id='ghana' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Ajuk has also been flagged by Ghanaian media. In 2015, The Finder wrote that Centurion director Genevive Kabukuor Ocansey was arrested and detained for allegedly aiding a Cameroonian — Eyong — to launder $2.5 million into Ghana and repatriate $1 million to Equatorial Guinea.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='ghana' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">The report stated that, after a tip-off, officials of the Bank of Ghana undertook several months of investigations and arrested Ocansey, who on the Centurion website is the company’s director in Ghana. The article noted that: “Her accomplice, Njoy Ayuk Eyong, also known as NJ Ayuk MBA, is out of Ghana at the moment.”</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Three months after <i>M&G</i> published the report on Eyong, we were forced to take down the article.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">
		 United States website hosting service, Linode, informed <i>M&G</i> — which headquartered in Johannesburg — that they received a complaint regarding copyright infringement. A blogger claimed that the mg.co.za domain had plagiarised one of the blog’s articles about Njock Ajuk Eyong.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='philly' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Linode, which is based in Philadelphia, gave the publication 96 hours to take down the article. After reaffirming that the story had not been plagiarised, <i>M&G</i> was intent on fighting this. Complying would amount to censorship.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='philly' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Our hosting service failed to comply with the 96 hours notice and mg.co.za was offline. <i>M&G</i> took the article down.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='philly' class='map-chapter'>
		<img class="scrolly_image" src="/scrolly-map-assets/media/site_takedown_stats.JPG">
		<p class="scroll_prompt">In the early hours of Friday, when our website traffic is most active, Linode suspended its services.</p>

		<img class="scrolly_image" src='/scrolly-map-assets/media/aj_censored_article.jpg'>
		<p class="scroll_prompt">This was the <i>M&G</i> story on Ajuk which has not been removed from our website. View <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190621181041/https://mg.co.za/article/2019-06-21-00-fraudster-named-in-sas-oil-deal">here</a>.</p>

	<section id='philly' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>The complainant used the name Ian Simpson who — as far as we could tell — is fake.</p>
	</section>
	</section>
	<section id='newark' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>Ian told Linode that his address was “2428 Hilltop Haven Drive, Newark, New Jersey, 07102” but no such place can be found. A <i>M&G</i> correspondent in New York verified that the address does not exist.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='newark' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>Ian said he was the author of World Wide News Blogspot. But since the complaint was made,  the bylines of all the articles have been changed to Chris Lynn.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='newark' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>Public records of business owners in the US show that there is no one by that name living in the state of New York.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='newark' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>Ian also provided a phone number that is out of service.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='newark' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>But the fictitious address provided by Ian is not too far from the Congressman Donald Payne’s headquarters where Eyong worked before he was found guilty of fraud in 2007.</p>
