		<p class=pretty_box>On September 10, the <i>Mail & Guardian</i> received a notice from our hosting service, Linode.</p>

	<section id='introduction' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>The oldest online news website in Africa was accused of plagiarism.</p>

		<p class=pretty_box>A few days later the <i>M&G</i> website was shut down over an unverified complaint amounting to censorship of the media.</p>

	<section id='introduction' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>This is the story about how the <i>M&G</i> was attacked and the investigation that followed.</p>

		<p class=pretty_box>In May this year <i>M&G</i> started investigating a man known by many names - Njock Ajuk Eyong, also known as <mark>AJ Ajuk</mark>, and <mark>Njuck Eyong</mark> and now <mark>NJ AYUK JD, MBA</mark> - who owns Centurion Law is from Cameroon.</p>

	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Ajuk was also handpicked, allegedly by former <mark>Energy Minister Jeff Radebe</mark>, to be part of the multimillion South Sudan oil deal South Africa signed in 2019. <mark>The deal's estimated worth is R14.5-billion</mark></p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box"><i>M&G</i> saw court records from the district court for the District of Columbia in the US that reveal that, in 2007, Eyong was found guilty of <mark>impersonating congressman Donald Payne</mark> so he could <mark>issue visas to at least nine people who were then living in Cameroon</mark>.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='cameroon' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Ajuk was given numerous opportunities to provide <i>M&G</i> with comment. Instead, he sent the newspaper a <mark>threatening letter</mark>, never disputing that he was the man found guilty of fraud in the US back in 2007.</p>

		<p class="pretty_box">Ajuk has also been flagged by Ghanaian media in 2015.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='ghana' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">The Finder newspaper wrote that Centurion director <mark>Genevive Kabukuor Ocansey</mark> was arrested and detained for allegedly aiding a Cameroonian — Eyong — to <mark>launder $2.5 million</mark> into Ghana and <mark>repatriate $1 million</mark> to Equatorial Guinea.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='ghana' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">The report stated that, after a tip-off, officials of the Bank of Ghana undertook several months of <mark>investigations and arrested Ocansey</mark>, who on the Centurion website is the company’s director in Ghana.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='ghana' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">The article noted that: “Her accomplice, Njoy Ayuk Eyong, also known as <mark>NJ Ayuk MBA</mark>, is out of Ghana at the moment.”</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Three months after <i>M&G</i> published the report on Eyong, we were forced to take down the article.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">
		 United States website hosting service, Linode, informed <i>M&G</i> — which headquartered in Johannesburg — that a blogger claimed that the mg.co.za domain had plagiarised one of the blog’s articles about Njock Ajuk Eyong.</p>
	</section>

	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">When asked whether Linode investigated the complaint, Peter Fu, who is the company’s legal council, said that the company is unable to respond as it would “reveal internal security mechanisms and likely cause more instances of ticketing abuse.”
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box"><i>M&G</i>'s attacker successfully took advantage of loopholes in the DMCA to remove an investigative article in a foreign country.
		</p>
	</section>
		<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Public interest lawyer Avani Singh said that the DMCA allows for internet service providers and web hosting services to avoid liability if they act “expeditiously” in removing content. This means that content can be removed automatically with little consideration for whether the complaint is valid.
		</p>
	</section>
		<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">“In practice, the opportunity to challenge this [complaint] only arises once the content has already been removed. <a href="https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-103-issue-2/section-512-of-the-digital-millennium-copyright-act-user-experience-and-user-frustration/">Commentators</a> have described the DMCA as “one of the biggest threats to free speech online”, because the ‘notice and take-down scheme’ fails to provide affected websites with due process before the content is removed.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">
		“This forced acquiescence — often in the face of a threat that one’s website will be taken down completely if the content is not removed — and the administrative burden of having to file a counter-notice to justify the content, risks impeding both free speech and procedural fairness,” Singh said.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">
		One study, titled Notice and Takedown in Everyday Practice, published by researchers from Berkeley Law at the University of California in 2016 found that 72% of takedown requests analysed presented questions about their validity. “These notices often targeted social media, blogs, and personal websites, raising even greater questions about their effect on expression,” the research paper wrote.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">
		Singh added that matters are further complicated for non-US entities who have to deal with transnational jurisdiction should they choose to challenge the ISP in court.

	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">
		Approximately 1 000 host machines have been subject to “filtering” by Linode due to DMCA claims this year alone, said Fu.

		<p class="pretty_box">Linode, which is based in Philadelphia, gave <i>M&G</i>  96 hours to take down the article.</p>

		<p class="pretty_box">After reaffirming that the story had not been plagiarised, <i>M&G</i> was intent on fighting this. Complying would amount to censorship.</p>
