	<section id='introduction' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class=pretty_box>The oldest online news website in Africa was accused of plagiarism.</p>

		<p class="pretty_box"><i>The Finder</i> newspaper wrote that Centurion director <mark>Genevive Kabukuor Ocansey</mark> was arrested and detained for allegedly aiding a Cameroonian — Eyong — to <mark>launder $2.5-million</mark> into Ghana and <mark>repatriate $1-million</mark> to Equatorial Guinea.</p>

		<p class="pretty_box">Three months after the <i>M&G</i> published the report on Eyong, we received an email.</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">
		 United States website hosting service Linode informed the <i>M&G</i> — which is based in Johannesburg — that a blogger claimed that the <i>mg.co.za</i> domain had plagiarised one of the blog’s articles about Njock Ajuk Eyong.</p>
	</section>

	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">When asked whether Linode had investigated the complaint, Peter Fu, who is the company’s legal council, said that the company is unable to respond as it would “reveal internal security mechanisms and likely cause more instances of ticketing abuse”.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">The <i>M&G</i>'s attacker has successfully taken advantage of loopholes in the legislation of the DMCA to remove an investigative article in a foreign country.
		</p>
	</section>
		<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">Public interest lawyer Avani Singh said that the DMCA allows internet service providers (ISPs) and web hosting services to avoid liability if they act “expeditiously” in removing content. This means that content can be removed automatically with little consideration for whether the complaint is valid.
		</p>
	</section>
		<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">“In practice, the opportunity to challenge this [complaint] only arises once the content has already been removed. <a href="https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-103-issue-2/section-512-of-the-digital-millennium-copyright-act-user-experience-and-user-frustration/" target="_blank">Commentators</a> have described the DMCA as 'one of the biggest threats to free speech online', because the ‘notice and take-down scheme’ fails to provide affected websites with due process before the content is removed," Singh said.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">
		“This forced acquiescence — often in the face of a threat that one’s website will be taken down completely if the content is not removed — and the administrative burden of having to file a counter-notice to justify the content, risks impeding both free speech and procedural fairness,” Singh said.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">
		One study, titled Notice and Takedown in Everyday Practice, published by researchers from Berkeley Law at the University of California in 2016 found that 72% of takedown requests analysed presented questions about their validity. “These notices often targeted social media, blogs and personal websites, raising even greater questions about their effect on expression,” the research paper stated.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id='mg-office' class='map-chapter'>
		<p class="pretty_box">
		Singh added that matters are further complicated for non-US entities that have to deal with transnational jurisdiction should they choose to challenge the ISP in court.

		About 1 000 host machines have been subject to “filtering” by Linode due to DMCA claims this year alone, said Fu.
